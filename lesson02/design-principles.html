            <h2>Contrast - <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/" target="_blank">Best Buy</a></h2>
            <img src="images/www.bestbuy.com_(iPhone XR).png" alt="screenshot of Bestbuy website" width="300">
            <p>As seen in the from the website above Best Buy has implemented a good use of Contrast. One example of how they use
                contrast to thier advantage is through color. The red outline where it says "Top Deals" uses the contrast of the red on
                 blue to draw attention to this first. Then we can see they have used the same technique with the yellow on the "Shop Now"
                button and also for the descriptions under each image. All of this makes the page more readable and also directs the user
                where to look and what is most important.

            <h2>White Space - <a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank">Google</a></h2>
            <img src="images/www.google.com_(iPhone 12 Pro).png" alt="screenshot of Google website" width="300">
            <p>Google is probably a perfect example of a good use of White space. As seen above they focus on what is most important on their
                website and dont shy away from leaving the rest blank and simple. The page has you first focus on the Google logo itself then 
                the search bar, leaving all other space white. I believe this is perfect for this website since its purpose is for its users to 
                search for other topics. Therefore by leaving black white space it allows the user to focus on what they came to do and not get
                distracted by other images or text they do not need.

            <h2>Proximity - <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/?lang=eng" target="_blank">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints</a></h2>
            <img src="images/www.churchofjesuschrist.org__lang=eng(iPhone 12 Pro).png" alt="screenshot of church of jesus christ website" width="300">
            <p>The church of Jesus Christ's website does a very good job at using the principle of Proximity to make thier website more understandable to 
                the user. On the website there can be found many
                 articles, videos, and images. With each of which they use proximity between the text descriptions and the images to show a connection. 
                 As seen above many go as far as having the text overlap onto the image. This gives the user a clear indication of which description 
                 goes with which image.
